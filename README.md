sos-website

The primary purpose of this website is to help SOS do their jobs.

There are a ton of different tasks to do, and those change over time.
Also, how we do them changes, and as we learn, we change them too.
So this is a place to document and share that knowledge, because it's
too hard to supervise and learn at the same time.

How will it help:
1. An online instruction manual (with articles you can print out).
2. a place to discuss new methods of doing things, and ask questions about existing ones.
3. Tools directory (just in case you don't know what something is!)
4. An SOS directory, because it's good to be able to find out who knows what.
